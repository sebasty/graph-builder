### Node Graph Application Documentation
## Overview
This application allows users to create, move, and connect nodes (circles and squares) dynamically on a canvas. The nodes can be connected via lines, and the connections are maintained as nodes are moved. Additionally, users can delete nodes and their associated connections. The application is responsive and adjusts to various screen sizes.

### Features

## 1. Create Nodes
Add circle or square nodes via buttons from the palette.
Nodes are placed randomly within the canvas.

## 2. Delete Nodes
Option 1: Right-click on a node to delete it.
Option 2: Use the "Remove Node" button to delete the currently selected node.

## 3. Connect Nodes
To connect 2 nodes:
1. Click on one node.
2. Click "CONNECT NODES" button. 
3. Button will turn "green" and will show ON instead of OFF.
4. Click on the second node you want to connect whit.
Node are connected via a line.
Connections are maintained even when nodes are moved.
All Nodes can be connected between them using same strategy.

## 4. Move Nodes
Drag and drop nodes to move them within the canvas.
Lines connecting nodes update dynamically during movement.

## 5. Responsive Design
Canvas and UI adjust dynamically to various screen sizes.
Buttons stack vertically on smaller screens for better accessibility.
